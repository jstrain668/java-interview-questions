    // one to the number of 1-bits. We can check the ith bit of a number using a bit mask.
    // We start with a mask m=1 because
    // the binary representation of 1 is, 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001
    // Clearly, a logical AND between any number and the mask 1 gives us the least significant
    // bit of this number. To check the next bit, we shift the mask to the left by one.
    // 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0010. And so on.
    // Time Complexity: O(n)
    // Space Complexity: O(1)
