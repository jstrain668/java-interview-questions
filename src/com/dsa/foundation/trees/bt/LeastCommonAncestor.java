//Question: Given a binary tree (not a binary search tree) and two values say n1 and n2, write a program to find the
// least common ancestor.

//The lowest common ancestor between two nodes n1 and n2 is defined as the lowest node in T that has both n1 and n2 as
// descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).
//The LCA of n1 and n2 in T is the shared ancestor of n1 and n2 that is located farthest from the root.
